Description: A comprehensive toolkit providing methods for naming cell clusters, identifying marker genes, and conducting statistical analyses in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. These methods support the CSSG algorithm, which precisely subdivides heterogeneous cell clusters by analyzing binary gene occurrence patterns, iteratively selecting optimal gene combinations, and minimizing unexplained cell loss and heterogeneity.
